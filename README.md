# Graph Calculator

This project was for my Part II Software Engineering Course at the University of Auckland. <br />
The objective was to implement common data structures and understand their complexity. <br />

I was tasked to create my own data structures that could implement Breadth-First Search(BFS) and Depth-First Search(DFS) in O(1) time complexity.
I was further exposed to properties of a graph such as equivalence classes.

## Requirements
**OOP**: I must represent graphs using object-oriented concepts <br />
**Complexity:** Implement search algorithms of BFS & DFS in O(1) time complexity. <br />
**Design Patterns**: I must implement my own data structures for BFS and DFS, I am not allowed to import lists to aid me. <br />
**Java Conventions**: I must follow proper Java conventions and best practices such as CNAME, MNAME, VNAME, JAVADOC and others <br />
**Time Limit**: I was given a 3-week fixed deadline.

## Testing
Unit testing was performed using the JUnit testing framework. <br />
These tests were designed to ensure that the requirements of OOP, Design Patterns, Code Style, Complexity and functionality were kept.

## What I could improve on
**Optimization:** While the BFS & DFS are in O(1) time complexity, there are other areas of code where performance can be optimised.
**More features:** I could add more algorithms like dijkstra's algorithm.
**Exception Handling:** I could create more error checks to ensure that the system will not fail to unexpected inputs.
